# TSCodeChallenges
Code challenges / solutions implemented in Typescript.

## Build
When writing new solutions, it is helpful to build in watch mode to catch any
build errors as you go with:

```
yarn build:watch
```


To dyamically generate the solutions table and add it to the README, run:
```
yarn build:readme
```

## Test
Each solution should have its own tests to verify the integrity of the solution.
To run the test suite, run:

```
yarn test
```

## Solutions

| Solution | Description |
|:---------:|:---------:|
| [LeftRotation](https://github.com/mcclayton/TSCodeChallenges/tree/master/./src/LeftRotation/index.ts) | Given an array of `n` integers and a number, `d`, perform `d` left rotations on the array. |
| [PathSum](https://github.com/mcclayton/TSCodeChallenges/tree/master/./src/PathSum/index.ts) | Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum. |
