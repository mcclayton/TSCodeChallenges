# TSCodeChallenges
Code challenges / solutions implemented in Typescript.
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/mcclayton/TSCodeChallenges.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/mcclayton/TSCodeChallenges)

## Build
When writing new solutions, it is helpful to build in watch mode to catch any
build errors as you go with:

```
yarn build:watch
```


To dyamically generate the solutions table and add it to the README, run:
```
yarn build:readme
```

## Test
Each solution should have its own tests to verify the integrity of the solution.
To run the test suite, run:

```
yarn test
```
